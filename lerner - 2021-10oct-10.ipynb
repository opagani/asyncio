    "The problem with current concurrency is:\n",
    "- Threads are lightweight, but hard to work with... and even lightweight threads can overburden a server at a certain point.\n",
    "- Processes are easier to work with, and you can even have a lot of them on a server, but they are very heavyweight, and can bring your server down.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reactor pattern says:\n",
    "- Have one process\n",
    "- Have one thread\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is: You have a list of functions, and you loop over that list again and again and again. You give each function the chance to execute for a little bit of time.  This way, you can handle a ton of incoming network connections, because the only overhead is additional functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time we get a new network connection, we run a function a new time. If there are *n* incoming connections, then we're running our function *n* times.  Because the overhead of a function is so much lower than threads or processes, we can get away with this.\n",

    "`asyncio` **DOES NOT PROMISE** that our code will run in parallel.  Each of our \"tasks\" will get a little bit of time to run, before it's expected to cede control back to the other tasks we're running.  But that's OK, because it'll cede control when it knows it'll have to wait a while before getting more communication.\n",
