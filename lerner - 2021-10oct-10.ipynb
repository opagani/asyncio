    "The problem with current concurrency is:\n",
    "- Threads are lightweight, but hard to work with... and even lightweight threads can overburden a server at a certain point.\n",
    "- Processes are easier to work with, and you can even have a lot of them on a server, but they are very heavyweight, and can bring your server down.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reactor pattern says:\n",
    "- Have one process\n",
    "- Have one thread\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is: You have a list of functions, and you loop over that list again and again and again. You give each function the chance to execute for a little bit of time.  This way, you can handle a ton of incoming network connections, because the only overhead is additional functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time we get a new network connection, we run a function a new time. If there are *n* incoming connections, then we're running our function *n* times.  Because the overhead of a function is so much lower than threads or processes, we can get away with this.\n",
